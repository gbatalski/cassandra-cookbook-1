# DESCRIPTION

Installs and configures [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and
high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

Cassandra's ColumnFamily data model offers the convenience of column indexes
with the performance of log-structured updates, strong support for materialized
views, and powerful built-in caching.
